MyMod.xs and INLINE.h were created by cd'ing to the directory that contains this file and 
running a script that contained the Inline::C2XS function:

c2xs("MyMod", "MyMod", ".", {AUTOWRAP => 1});

'MyMod.pm', 'Makefile.PL', 't/test.t' and README (this file) were hand written - just to
make the demo complete. To build MyMod just run:

perl Makefile.PL
make test

You could even run 'make install' if you want - but I don't know why you would actually
want to install this module.
