Convert Inline::C or Inline::CPP code to XS code. See the module's documentation for details.

Both Inline::C and Inline::CPP are pre-requisites. If you don't want to utilise the 
C++ to XS capability, then it's not really necessary to install Inline::CPP. You could
just install Inline::C2XS anyway (though you'll see a warning about the fact that 
Inline::CPP cannot be found, and the t\t_cpp.t tests will fail) and so long as Inline::C 
can be found, the C to XS capability of Inline::C2XS will work just fine.

Build in the usual way:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install
